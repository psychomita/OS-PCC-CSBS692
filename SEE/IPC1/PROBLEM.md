```
Write programs in C to implement IPC using Named pipe, where the sender
process will take a string in lower case, starting index and Number of characters
as input. Then send them to the 2nd process, which will extract the substring
from the input string based on the starting index and number of characters. It
will also convert the sub-string to all UPPERCASE and send the final string
back to the sender, which will print it.
