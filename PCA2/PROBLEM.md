```
1. Write programs in C to implement IPC using Named pipe, where the sendernprocess will take a string in lower case,
starting index and Number of characters as input. Then send them to the 2nd process, which will extract the substring
from the input string based on the starting index and number of characters. It will also convert the sub-string to
all UPPERCASE and send the final string back to the sender, which will print it.
```
```
2. WAP in C to implement IPC using Signal, where the parent process will create a child process. The parent will send
a signal to the child after every 10 seconds. Upon receiving the signal, the child will take a string as input and
print it in the aLtErNaTe case and will pause. This will continue until a keyboard interrupt occurs from the user.
```
```
3. WAP in C to compute the prime numbers between 1 and N (user input) by creating 10 threads and equally
distributing the job to all the threads to compute the prime numbers and print them in ordered sequence.
For example, thread-1 will compute the prime numbers between 1 and 10 and will print them first, while thread-10
will compute the prime numbers between 91 and 100, if N=100.
```
```
4. WAP in C to create two threads. The Main thread will take a series of integers as input and send the first half
of the series to Thread-1 and second half to Thread2. Thread-1 will sort the elements in ascending order and return
it back to Main, where Thread-2 will sort the elements in descending order and return it back to Main. The Main
thread will print these arrays on screen.
