# Assignment: 7

```
1)  Write a Program to demonstrate the use of signal. The process will print a message infinitely until an interrupt
    signal occurs. It will handle the signal and will print a message along with the signal number that it has got.
    (Help: signal(SIGINT,SIG_DFL))

2)  Write a Program to create a child process. The parent process will stop until an alarm is received from the
    child process.

3) Write a Program to create a child process. The parent will send a signal to the child every 5 seconds and the
   child will handle the signal and check if a number (user input) is a leap year or not.
