# Assignment: 8
```
1. a) Write a C program in LINUX to create a thread that determines the summation of N natural numbers using POSIX thread library.

b) Modify the above program where the value of N should be passed as argument to the thread function and the final result after summation should be returned to the main thread from the sub-thread.

2. Write a C program to compute the prime numbers between 1 to 100 using ten sub-threads by equally dividing the range (1-100) between the ten threads. Each thread will compute the prime numbers within its own range and print them.
```
